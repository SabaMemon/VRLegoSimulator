# TermProject
With the Lego simulator project, we hope to provide a creative outlet in the form of an immersive 3D space to allow people to visualise an environment through the lens of architecture development. We hope to see individuals interact with our project and create various depictions of what a scene could look like lego bricks in the sco-pe of VR.
